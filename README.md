# Supervised-Machine-learning-with-R
This project displays the code used to predict heart disesase via supervised classification machine learning
The project aims to predict heart diseases of patients given various variables and the data set was split into 80% train and 20% test. The support vector model was tested for this project and also logistic regression of the model was also tested. The accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of the models seems to be of precision; especially with the AIC obtained from the logistic regression model.
